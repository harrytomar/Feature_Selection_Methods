#Constant Features
Constant Features that show single values in all the observations in the dataset. These features provide no information that allows the ML models to predict the target.

#Quasi Constant Feature
Quasi-constant features, as the name suggests, are the features that are almost constant. In other words, these features have the same values for a very large subset of the outputs. Such features are not very useful for making predictions
